## Projects
### QCA Forge

**QCA Forge** is a research-oriented modeling environment for Quantum Dot Cellular Automata (QCA) that enables the design, simulation, and analysis of QCA circuits.

**Key Features:**

- **Interactive Circuit Design:** Visual composition and manipulation of QCA structures.
- **Python-Scriptable Core:** Complete programmatic control through Python bindings.
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Immediate feedback during circuit development with dynamic plotting.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

*QCA Forge is currently in its early stages. Please contact me for access!*

### HealthLens SDoH
**HealthLens SDoH** is a developer-mode Chrome extension that detects U.S. addresses on webpages and overlays contextual Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) data in real time. It leverages the [AHRQ SDoH Database](https://www.ahrq.gov/sdoh/data-analytics/sdoh-data.html) to visualize key community-level factors impacting public health.

- Automatically finds U.S. addresses and displays SDoH metrics across five domains (economic, education, healthcare, environment, community)
- Provides life expectancy estimates, a 0‚Äì10 zip code health equity score benchmarked against national averages, and an LLM summary.
- Open source, open database, and modular. Originally developed at Wacode Hackathon 2025.

*Ideal for health equity research, homebuyers, and contextual data analysis.*
